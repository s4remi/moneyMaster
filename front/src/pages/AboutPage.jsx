              <h2>
                ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am currently a student in the Khoury College of
                Computer Science at Northeastern University, San Francisco
                campus.
              </h2>
              <p>
                I am hoping to graduate in 2024. Prior to this, I earned my
                B.Eng in civil Engineering and AS in Mathematics. I am highly
                interested in most areas of computer science, with a particular
                interest in computer graphics such as AR, VR, Visualization, and
                Computer Vision.
              </p>
              <p>
                I hope to maintain my passion for computer graphics and pursue
                relevant job opportunities in the future. In addition to
                computer graphics, I am also interested in backend development
                technologies such as distributed systems and networking.
              </p>
